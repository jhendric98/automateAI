AI Chat System with RAG - Test Document

This is a test document for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality.

Key Features:
1. The system uses Qdrant for vector storage
2. Documents are processed and chunked automatically
3. FastEmbed is used for generating embeddings
4. The system supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT files

How it Works:
- Upload documents using the + button next to the chat input
- Documents are automatically chunked and embedded
- When you ask questions, the system searches for relevant context
- The AI uses the context to provide more accurate answers

Technical Details:
- Embeddings are 384-dimensional using BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model
- Text is chunked with tiktoken for optimal token management
- Qdrant runs in-memory for local development
- OpenAI API is used for the chat completions

This test document can be used to verify that the RAG system is working correctly.
